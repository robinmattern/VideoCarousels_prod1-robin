## Video Carousels

   This repository contains three sets of videos that can
   be viewed in a carousel of slides, one for each video, similar to a slideshow without playing the videos. The viewer can jump to any of the video by clicking on a video name in the initial Table of Contents, 
   clicking on the Previous / Next buttons or the clicking on a page number.  The viewer can also play an individual video thereby causing the slideshow to pause. <br><br>   

   In some cases there is a secondary list of Cue Points.  Clicking on a cue point label will cause the video 
   to start playing from that point on. When the end of a video is reached, the next one will play until the
   viewer stops the videos from playing and resumes the slideshow. <br><br>  

   The three videos were captured from three newsworthy topics: 
  ### 1. Interviews on Fox by black leaders 
  They discuss how destructive the BLM riots were to the black communities as well as efforts they are making to help restore families and hope to their neighbors. 

  ### 2. A recent hour-long special by Tucker Carlson
  He stresses the importance of families and beauty in various interviews and speeches. He points out that if Republican 
  candidates focus on these positive messages, they will win their elections. 

  ### 3. Basil Nikas reporting from Modova
  Basil is an ex-pat living there describes the efforts being made by the Molvovians to help the citizens of Ukraine as the war broke our in March, 2022.
